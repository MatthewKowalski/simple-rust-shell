# Simple Rust Shell

---
## Purpose
As a way to learn more of Rust, I decided to follow a [guide](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/) and create a simple shell.

My intentions for this project are to follow the guide until the end and build up an understanding. From there, I then plan to refactor the code and implement further features.


## Sources
This project utilizes the following sources:

* Primary Guide: ["Build Your Own Shell using Rust"](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/)
* Idea from the [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) list
